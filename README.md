Well, my nephew loves ðŸ¦– dinosaurs ðŸ¦–.

So, I built something ...

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, get your API key from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) and add it to your `.env.local` at the root of your project.

```
PIXABAY_API_KEY=YourSuperSecretKey
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
